# angel-td
Simple 2D Tower Defence game written using the Bevy game engine

**DISCLAIMER:**
I just started developing, so the "game" is not in any form playable at this point.

## Running the game
**NOTE:**
having `rustup` with the newest version of `rust` and `cargo` installed is required to run the game
```
git clone https://github.com/Faervan/angel-td.git
cd angel-td
cargo run
```
**WARNING:**
The resolution is currently hardcoded to 1920x1080, I am unaware of how launching the game on a monitor with a larger resolution will behave.
